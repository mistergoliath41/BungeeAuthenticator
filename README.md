## Description
Based on the OnlyProxyJoin concept this plugin allows you to prevent direct connections to your Spigot server with a security token instead of detecting if connections come from your Bungeecord IP to prevent IP Spoofing.

## Config File
```yaml
# For security issues, it's HIGHLY important to change this token to a UNIQUE token made by YOURSELF and this token must be the SAME on BOTH Bungeecord AND Spigot.
token: "8S96XL9qe7CDu8GRehzfgQzge2tMZAvghYPpWNPdYqqCgVzNTGwScgESRhPSZCnJZWRMUm"
```
